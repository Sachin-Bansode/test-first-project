                 -------------------------------------Mock Test-----------------------------------------------

Mock Test is a part of my MINOR PROJECT.
It includes the testing of the Analytical and cognitive skills of the students through a Quiz Based Platform.Here Multiple choice questions would be generated randomly to each student from a pool of questions.Each Question has 4 choice out of which only 1 option is correct.In a session the student can travesrse back and fortch across the questions as many times they wish and can deselect  marked option and select the new one.On the completion of the test the student can even see how many questions were wrong and how many did he/she skip during the test.Also it provides advice about which topics are weak for the student so that student can practise more on those topics.
